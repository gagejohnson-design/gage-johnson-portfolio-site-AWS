        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I bring a full-lifecycle perspective to enterprise technology—how
          software is evaluated, implemented, adopted, and trusted through
          reliable data and clear delivery. I’m a Data Management Consultant,
          and I’m actively building full-stack and AWS fundamentals to deepen my
          technical execution.

        <h2>What I Do Today</h2>

          alt="Enterprise delivery and data work static image"
        />
        <p>
          In my current role, I support enterprise implementations across
          multiple business units. I partner with developers, architects, and
          business stakeholders to clarify requirements, resolve system issues,
          and keep delivery moving.
        </p>
        <p>
          A big part of my work is improving data reliability—validating
          migrations through QA cycles, strengthening data quality, and
          supporting readiness so teams can operate confidently after go-live.
        </p>

      <section class="about-section card">
        <h2>My Path</h2>
        <p>
          I started in SaaS sales, where I learned how organizations evaluate
          solutions and what it takes to communicate value across business and
          technical audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, I moved into functional consulting and delivery—working
          closer to requirements, process alignment, testing cycles, and user
          enablement.
        </p>
        <p>
          That progression led me to data management consulting, where I bring
          together business context and delivery execution to help teams launch
          reliable systems people actually use.
        </p>

      <section class="about-section card">
        <h2>What I’m Learning and Practicing</h2>
        <img
          class="about-img"
          src="img/aws-home.png"
          alt="Gage's AWS Environment Home"
        />
        <p>
          I’m building engineering fundamentals through bootcamp projects, side
          work, and consistent practice. My focus is on application structure,
          working with APIs and databases, and improving my ability to build
          maintainable features end-to-end.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the cloud side, I’m progressing through Adriaan Cantrill’s AWS
          Solutions Architect course with hands-on labs to strengthen how cloud
          environments are configured, secured, and operated.

      <section class="about-section card">
        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        <p>
          I work top-down—aligning on goals, user needs, and success criteria
          before execution. I’m comfortable bridging technical and non-technical
          teams, clarifying requirements early, and translating ambiguity into
          clear, actionable next steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          I move iteratively, validate assumptions, and prioritize quality. I
          focus on the end-user experience, test functionality early, and use
          modern tools to troubleshoot efficiently—always aiming to deliver
          solutions teams can trust and adopt.

        <h2>A Little More Human</h2>
        <img src="img/personal.png" alt="Me on trip in Vietnam" />
        <p>
          Outside of work, I’m big on travel, food, and finding new coffee
          spots—my dream “job” would look a lot like Guy Fieri’s: exploring
          places, meeting people, and trying great food. I also enjoy the gym
          and fitness, side projects, science and history, and spending time
          with my girlfriend and family.
