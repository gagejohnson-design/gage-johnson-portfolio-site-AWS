        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I bring a full-lifecycle perspective to enterprise technology: how
          software is sold, implemented, adopted, and trusted through reliable
          data and clear delivery. I’m a Data Management Consultant by trade,
          and I’m actively building full-stack and AWS fundamentals to deepen my
          technical execution.

        <h2>My Path</h2>
        <img src="img/consulting.png" alt="Consulting Image" />
        <p>
          I started in SaaS sales, where I learned how organizations evaluate
          solutions and what it takes to communicate value across business and
          technical audiences. From there, I moved into functional consulting
          and delivery, working closer to requirements, process alignment,
          testing cycles, and user enablement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I work in data management consulting—supporting enterprise
          implementations across multiple business units. I spend a lot of time
          improving data quality, validating migrations through QA cycles, and
          collaborating with developers, architects, and stakeholders to
          troubleshoot issues and keep delivery moving.
        </p>

      <section class="about-section card">
        <h2>What I Do in My Role</h2>
        <img src="img/consulting.png" alt="Systems Delivery Image" />
        <p>
          My work is a mix of systems coordination and hands-on validation. I
          help translate business needs into clear documentation and actionable
          delivery steps, then support testing and readiness so teams can
          operate confidently after go-live.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve contributed to stronger go-live outcomes by improving data
          quality and migration accuracy through validation and QA cycles, and
          I’ve built automation to structure large volumes of unorganized
          documentation—saving teams significant time and making deliverables
          easier to use.
        </p>

      <section class="about-section card">
        <h2>What I’m Learning and Practicing</h2>
        <img src="img/dev.png" alt="Developer Image" />
        <p>
          I’m building engineering fundamentals through bootcamp projects, side
          work, and consistent practice. My focus is on understanding
          application structure, working with APIs and databases, and improving
          my ability to build maintainable features end-to-end.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the cloud side, I’m progressing through Adriaan Cantrill’s AWS
          Solutions Architect course and self-study, with hands-on labs to
          strengthen how cloud environments are configured, secured, and
          operated.
        </p>

      <section class="about-section card">
        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        <img src="img/Cloud.png" alt="Cloud Image" />
        <p>
          I work top-down—aligning on business goals, user needs, and success
          criteria before execution. With a foundation in SaaS sales and
          functional consulting, I focus on bridging technical and non-technical
          teams, clarifying requirements early, and translating ambiguity into
          clear, actionable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continue building my skills in full-stack development and cloud,
          I apply the same mindset: move iteratively, validate assumptions, and
          prioritize quality and scalability. I approach problems from the
          end-user perspective, test functionality first, and use modern tools
          to troubleshoot efficiently—always focused on delivering solutions
          people actually adopt and organizations can grow with.

        <h2>A Little More Human</h2>
        <img src="img/consulting.png" alt="Personal Interests Image" />
        <p>
          Outside of work, I’m big on travel, food, and finding new coffee
          spots—my dream “job” would look a lot like Guy Fieri’s: exploring
          places, meeting people, and trying great food. I also enjoy the gym
          and fitness, side projects, science and history, and spending time
          with my girlfriend and family.
