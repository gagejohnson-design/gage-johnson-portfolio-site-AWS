        <p>
          I work in enterprise systems and data delivery, helping teams move
          complex platforms from design through adoption. My path through SaaS
          sales, functional consulting, and data management has given me a
          practical view of how technology is evaluated, implemented, governed,
          and trusted inside real organizations.

        <h2>💼 What I Do Now</h2>
        <p>
          In my current role, I support enterprise implementations across
          multiple business units and partner daily with developers, architects,
          and business stakeholders to clarify requirements and resolve system
          issues. A big part of my work is improving data reliability through
          validation and QA cycles—helping teams hit strong go-live outcomes and
          reduce post-go-live support needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also build practical automation to structure large volumes of
          unorganized documentation, speeding up delivery and making handoffs
          cleaner for project teams.

        <h2>💻 What I’m Building Now</h2>
        <p>
          I’m building hands-on technical depth through full-stack mini-projects
          and cloud self-study. This website is hosted on AWS, and I’m working
          through Adriaan Cantrill’s Solutions Architect course to strengthen
          real-world cloud fundamentals through labs and architecture exercises.
