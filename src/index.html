        <p>
          I've worked across enterprise systems and data delivery, helping teams
          move complex platforms from design through adoption in project
          settings. My path through SaaS sales, functional consulting, and data
          management has given me a practical view of how technology is
          evaluated, implemented, governed, and trusted inside today's
          enterprise environment.

        <h2>💼 My Role</h2>

        <p>
          In my current role, I support enterprise software rollouts and partner
          daily with developers, architects, and business stakeholders to
          clarify requirements, resolve system issues, and keep delivery moving.
        </p>

        <p>
          I focus heavily on data reliability through validation and QA
          cycles—helping teams launch with confidence, hit strong go-live
          outcomes, and reduce post-go-live support.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recognized by managers and leaders as a fast learner who takes full
          ownership of complex initiatives, I’m known for strong preparation,
          clear communication, and attention to detail.

        <p>
          I’m building hands-on technical depth through the UTD Fullstack
          Academy Bootcamp and cloud self-study. This website is hosted on AWS,
          and I’m working through Adriaan Cantrill’s Solutions Architect course
          to strengthen real-world cloud fundamentals through labs and
          architecture exercises.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Full-Stack Practice:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
            Node.js, Express
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data &amp; APIs:</strong> PostgreSQL, MongoDB, REST APIs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AWS Fundamentals:</strong> S3, EC2, IAM, VPC, CloudFront
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Workflow:</strong> Git/GitHub, CI/CD concepts, Docker basics
